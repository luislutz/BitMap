# BitMap
Multifunction Eurorack Module with 8 Bit ADC and DAC in the Guts


Basic Function:


Conversion of analog voltage in 8 Bit digital value

Possibility of swapping individual bits and switching them off manually, 
aswell as removing the bits in order via the voltage controlled Bitcrush-Knob

Reconversion of digital 8 Bit value in analog voltage

ADC and DAC can be used as completely seperate Units.
ADC: 1 analog Input, 8 digital bit outputs based on the input voltage (Gates)


Different Use Cases:

Voltage Controlled Bitreducing of CV and Audio signals
Reducing Sample Rate of CV and Audio Signals (S&H)
Random Voltage and Gate Source
Sequencing Drums with mutes (up to 9 channels)
Quantizing of pitch CV (Chromatic and unusal scales)
VCA and Ringmodulator
Sequencer for pitch CV
Sequence Transformation
Slew and Low pass filtering of output with switchable range (passive)
Strange Wavefolder (swapping or switching individula bits of Audio)
Distortion (hardclipping at 10vpp)
Noise source (9 times digital noise with different rates and one 8 bit white noise) 
Compatible with Leibniz system from Xaoc!
